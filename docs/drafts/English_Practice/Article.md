## Which tourist attraction in your city would you recommend to your colleagues?Why?
I'd **definitely** recommend Dapeng **Peninsula** to my colleagues, It's this amazing **coastal** area not far from the city--less than an hour's drive--so you don't have to go far to escape the busy city life.The best part is the beach, where you can swim in the clear water or even try surfing lessons if you're feeling **adventurous**.There are also these **charming old villages** with traditional architecture that feel like stepping back in time.What I love most is renting a bike and cycling along the **coastal** road--you get these **incredible** views of the sea and mountains all at once.Oh, and the seafood is a must-try! The restaurants there serve the freshest fish and shellfish, and it's super affordable compared to the city. If you want to make a day of it, there are cozy little hotels near the beach where you can stay overnight and wake up to a beautiful sunrise over the ocean. It's perfect for relaxing or having fun with friends, so I think everyone would enjoy it.
## What would your like to do if you had a day off tomorrow?
If I had a date off tomorrow, I'd properly sleep until noon, because there are many work to be done in this week and I have been m so tired lately. When I wake up, I'll order some food for lunch, maybe rice, noodles or dumplings, spicy noodles are my favorite food,I eat them most often. afterward, I plan to go swimming at the gym like I usually do, I love jumping into the pool from the edge and blowing bubbles underwater, it's so relaxing and fun, I'll swim for about two hours, then ride the shared bike around my neighborhood and find a restaurant for dinner, when I get home, I'll take a hot shower to unwind. In the evening, I'll listen to music or watch a movie while snaking--there are always snacks at my place. that's my plan for tomorrow, sounds great.
## What do you use social media for?
Social media is really useful in my daily life. The main uses is for getting new from internet, it keeps me connect with the world, I usually get the new by checking the hot topics in the weibo. the secondary uses is for communication, I mainly use WeChat to keep in touch with friends and family. It's super convenient for sending messages or making video calls with each other, especially since I can chat with relatives who live in other cities. Besides that,  I often scroll through Douyin during my free time. I watch short videos about dancing or singing for fun, but sometimes I also learn things--like math **tutorials** or cooking tips. I guess those are my main uses; get news, staying connected and getting **entertained** or learning new stuff .
## Do you like making plans?
Yeah, I actually really enjoy making plans because it helps me feel more in control and less stressed. For example, when I have a work project, I'll break it down into smaller tasks first. I will list out what needs to be done first, second and so on, then set deadlines for each part. That way, I can check my progress and adjust if something takes longer than expected. Planning trips is another thing I love. If I'm going hiking, I'll check the weather forecast first--if it's going to rain, I'll pack an umbrella or raincoat. And if it's going to be really hot. I make sure to bring extra water and maybe a hat. It just means I don't end up stuck in bad situations, like getting caught in the rain without proper gear. I guess the main reason I like planning is that it makes everything go more smoothly. It might take a bit of time upfront, bug it saves me from having to rush or worry later. So yeah, I definitely prefer having a plan rather than winging it!
## What apps have you recently used?
I've beed using several apps almost daily lately. Weibo is definitely my go-to for staying updated--I check trending topics every morning to catch up  on news and what's happening globally. It really helps me stay connected to current events without having to read long articles. Then there's WeChat, which I use constantly for communication, It's super convenient for sending message or making a voice call with each other and I can chat with my family who live in other cities. I also scroll through Douyin a lot. I love watching short videos about dancing or singing. I also learn new things from it, like math tutorials or cooking skills. Those three apps are probably the ones I use most frequently now.
